Hello World!

It's Eva :)

I am a Data Scientist who blogs about her learning journey. I am interested in merging the human and machine learning processes. 

On this blog, you can find some of my notes on representation learning. I am looking for ways to make machine learning more human. Blogs will be about data journalism and me trying to reproduce research papers. Doing so, I want to report on my progress to break the projects down into smaller steps.

Also, I like to ride motorcycles and sew clothing :)

Finally, I have taught two courses. One in Python for Data Science and one course on Machine and Deep Learning. You can find the course materials here. Feel free to reach out if you would like to take part in any of the two courses or would like to collaborate. :)
